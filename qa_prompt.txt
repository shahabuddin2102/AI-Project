Your task is to extract only the most relevant and meaningful questionâ€“answer pairs from it.

Follow these strict rules:
- Use only the information present in the document.
- Do not invent, guess, or speculate.
- Avoid duplicate or similar questions.
- Include only clear, factual, and relevant Q&A pairs.
- Each answer must be a complete, well-structured paragraph including all available relevant details.
- If features are mentioned, include them naturally within the paragraph (no bullet points).
- Do not generate questions that cannot be answered based on the text.
- Respond only with a single valid JSON array.

Each object in the array must have two keys:
- `"question"`: the question text.
- `"answer"`: the full paragraph answer.

Respond in **this exact JSON format** (and nothing else):
[
  {
    "question": "Your first question?",
    "answer": "The full answer as a paragraph."
  },
  {
    "question": "Your second question?",
    "answer": "Another full answer as a paragraph."
  }
]

Do not include any text outside the JSON array. Your output must start with `[` and end with `]`.

Document:
